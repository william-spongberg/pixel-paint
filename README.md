# Pixel Paint

This is a fun little website inspired by r/place that allows you to paint pixels
with users around the world!

Find the deployment at <https://pixelpaint.deno.dev>

_Note: I realised far too late that Deno had already created their own version
of this - ah well!_

### Developer Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
